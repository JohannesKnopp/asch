title: Asch FAQ
---

# 1 The brief introduction of Asch

The original design purpose of Asch is to reduce the skill threshold for the developers.For example,it makes DAPP development and traditional web applications become rather similar  by adopting JavaScript as an application development language and supporting RDB (Relational Database) to store the transaction data,
These characteristics must be extremely attractive to developers and SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises). We believe the prosperousness of the ecosystem of the whole platform is highly dependent on the developers’ productivity. Asch is an open platform that is not limited to specific areas— such as finance, document storage, copyright proof—but also providing a series of underlying and abstract APIs. These APIs can be combined flexibly to implement different types of applications. In terms of consensus mechanism, Asch system inherits and enhances DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) algorithm to significantly reduce the probability of forking in blockchain and the risk of duplicate payments.
Most importantly, Asch’s sidechain-as-a-application (SaaA) mode alleviates the blockchain inflation issue, as well as makes dApp more adjustable and individualized. Asch is a prospective, low-cost, one-stop solution that will become the incubator of next generation decentralized application. The token of Asch is XAS, and the initial amount of XAS is 100 million.

How do we use wallet?

Beginners must see how to manipulate Asch account proficiently.
[Notes for wallet users](http://bbs.asch.so/topic/23/%E9%92%B1%E5%8C%85%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E9%A1%BB%E7%9F%A5)

Local Wallet（Full-nodes Wallet）

If you want to install Local Wallet by yourself, please refer to the article  [Asch Node Installation Guide](https://github.com/AschPlatform/asch-docs/blob/master/asch_install.md).

Mobile Wallet

Mobile wallet only needs to enter a master password when logging on at the very first time. Once you login, you will be required to set a gesture password, which allows you to access the mobile wallet afterwards.

# 4 What language is used to develop Asch?

Asch platform is developed in Node.js language. There are some underlying developed modules with C or C++ language. When encountering a bottleneck in performance, we could use C or C ++ to modularize it completely. Node.js is the necessary skill if you want to develop Asch platform. We will add more SDK (mainstream programming languages such as java, python, php, and Go.)

# 5 What frameworks does Asch use?

Asch itself is a framework that is convenient for users to develop blockchain dApps. Since it is developed in Node.js, certain existing modules, for instance, express, are used.

# 6 What features does Asch have?

1. Supporting side-chains (cross-chains). DApp data are stored in the side-chain, so the main chain data will not swell too fast.
2. The Advantages of Node.JS language.
3. Saving block data in relational database to reduce the difficulty of dApp development
4. The speed of block production is rapid. Producing one block per 10 seconds and confirming it fast.
5. There will be no forking issues.
6. Safe sandbox isolating mechanism

# 7 Why will Asch not fork?

Asch system uses consensus mechanism which is based on Delegated Proof of Stake(DPOS). However, on the bottom half of the algorithm, we use an optimized variant of PBFT algorithm. This algorithm can achieve the consistency of the loyal nodes by the message complexity of O(n ^ 2) and time complexity of O(1) at t<n/3 to prevent bifurcation. In the equation t represents the number of the Byzantine Failures nodes (any possible problems such as network latency, system crash, vicious attack), while n represents the number of all nodes.

# 8 Can Asch be mined?

Asch uses a non-Pow algorithm, so it can’t be mined. However, the benefits can be gained by running as delegators. Asch use AC1.0 consensus algorithm (an optimized dpos with pbft algorithm) to ensure the output of blocks through the delegate system.

Everyone can register to be a delegate; everyone can vote for any delegate, but only the top 101 delegates who get the most votes can forge blocks (accounting). Currently, a delegate can get 3.5 XAS as reward for forging one block, and each block takes 10 seconds to be forged.

# 9 How much is the initial circulation of Asch?

Asch’s initial circulation is 100 million.

# 10 How much is the circulating supply of Asch?

Asch doesn't have a mechanism that freezes the coins.Every XAS of the total supply is distributed in the public hands. The circulating supply is the same as total supply. You can check the total supply from a [blockchain explorer](https://explorer.asch.io/ ).


# 11 How much is Asch delegates’ returns?

Gross profit per day: 24*60*60/10*3.5=30240 XAS

Each trustee’s gross profit per day: 30240/101=299.4 XAS

The block rewards will decrease over time.Please click [here](https://github.com/AschPlatform/asch-docs/blob/master/asch_delegate_forging.md) to see the details.

# 12 How do we issue our own assets by Asch?

# 13 Which platform does Asch support?

Currently, Asch is fully supported by the Linux platform, while Windows can synchronize blocks but cannot produce blocks.
We are looking forward to being supported by more platforms in the future.

# 14 How does Asch differ from ETH and LISK?

Comparisons between Asch and ETH

|name|ASCH|ETH|
|-----|------|-------|
|Consensus Mechanism|DPOS and PBFT focuses more on decentration when comparing to Pow. Pow also has the problem of hushing power and centralization of mining. Compared to Pos, the right to keep accounts is transferred to the delegates. Nevertheless, the shareholders still have the decision-making power, which make the whole system more security and decentralization.|Pow+pos|
|Smart Contract Implementation|Side-chain. The data stores in the dApp.|Transaction scripts.  The data is all in the main chain, easily expanding.|
|Contract Language|Native JavaScript|Solidity is designed for developing smart contracts that run on the EVM. ETH lacks documents and has small audience and high threshold.|
|Expansibility|The application of side chain and side chain can be downloaded as users’ needs without causing the main chain expansion.|The surge of Dapp will pose risks to the whole blockchain.|
|Security|The side chain operates independently with no effects on the main chain.|The vulnerability of the dApp will affect the whole blockchain, for example, The DAO.|
|Confirmation Time of a Block|10s|15s|
|TPS|3000|20|

Comparisons between Asch and LISK

|Name|ASCH|LISK|
|-----|------|-------|
|Consensus Mechanism|DPOS+PBFT; the latter prevents forking and eliminate double payment by hijacking.|DPOS, which leads to forking and fixture blocks.|
|Sandbox|Real sandbox can limit side chain’s permissions.|ETH cannot restrict the side chain’s permission.|
|Non-critical Refinement & Optimization |1.Create and sign the transaction at the front and transfer the encrypted data to the back. 2.As long as the problem of front-end performance is solved, it will not cause dpos to system itself.3.As For data persistence, the savepoint and the rollback of database are widely adopted. It will not fix blocks and fork even in the poor network.|The user’s password is transmitted directly to the back-end, which Easy to record and access|
|TPS|3000|20|

# 18 What is the Asch inflation rate?
The block bonus will decrease as time goes by; the specific time is based on the height of a block in the future. The block bonus system starts form 464,500, with an initial reward of 3.5 coins, and is reduced every 3 million blocks, approximately a year. After the 15,464,500 blocks, bonuses are no longer diminishing, with a slight inflation rate of less than 1.5% a year (relative to the initial amount of 100 million).
The inflation rate is as follow： (calculated from the 464,500 block, at the point of block rewards generation, around October 7, 2016)

|Years|Inflation rate relieve to last year|Current block bonus sum (In units of 10,000 XAS)|
|-----|------|-------|
|First year|10.5%|1050|
|Second year|7.5%|900|
|Third year|5.9%|750|
|Fourth year|4.5%|600|
|Fifth year|2.2%|300|
|Sixth year|1.1%|150|

# 21 Side-chain (cross-chain) Introduction

The side chain does not refer to the side chain that Asch made for other blockchain, but to the Asch’s own side chain, i.e. Dapp.

Currently, node.js is the only development programming language. If you want to use Java, python, PHP and other language, all you need is to make the corresponding SDK. Everyone should give it a try. The main purpose is to write the library of Asch-js in other languages.

Qingfeng has been optimizing the convenience of Dapp development. More details will be revealed when releasing the Asch2.0.

The existing documents are as follows:
The introduction of Asch Dapp: notes on side chain related technologies
Dapp development tutorial 1: Asch Dapp Hello World - this document will teach you how to create and publish a basic side chain applications, and introduce the source code structure of the side chain framework.
Dapp development tutorial 2: Asch, Dapp, Asset
Dapp development tutorial 3: Asch Dapp Mini DAO - this document teaches you how to create new transaction types or smart contracts, and provides a Mini Dao project that includes project management and voting functions as demonstrations
Dapp development tutorial 4: Asch Dapp Dice Game development tutorial- this
document teach you how to create more complex types of transactions or smart contracts, how to establish the connections between contracts, how to rely on historical transaction data when enforcing contracts, and the realization of a dice game as a demo.
Dapp development tutorial 5: Release Dapp Online - this document teaches you how to register on the online system (testnet, mainnet), and how to install and uninstall.
