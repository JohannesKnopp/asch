title: 'DApp Development Tutorial 4:  Asch DApp Dice Game'
---

Compare with previous "mini dao" project, this "dice game" project has far more lines of codes, hence far more functionalities. The project generates three types of contracts, and there are dependencies among these three types. Also, the execution of the contracts must be accordant with historical transaction data.

However, this two projects still have very similar underlying logic. So please watch through the [source code](https://github.com/sqfasd/asch-dice-game-dapp) and you will find it is easy to understand.
